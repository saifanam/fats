# f(ATS)
A B2B and B2C platform that connects headhunters, vetted interviewers and jobseekers.

**Why f(ATS)?**

To address two problems:
- Employers can't fill a vacancy with a qualified candidate.
- There is no dearth of unemployed qualified candidates.

**What is the problem?**

A lot of employers use Application Tracking System (ATS) tools that sift through resumes. This means some resumes are not seen by a human at all. So if you apply to a job with a CV that doesn't have any of the keywords in it as in the JD, you probably won't hear back. A good number of employers outsource HR solutions and aren't aware of ATS. And a good number of jobseekers are also not aware of ATS.

**How it works:**

- The f(ATS) platform has three types of users: `Company`, `Interviewer` and `Jobseeker`.
- `Interviewer` is a vetted, registered user with certain skills and expertise. 
- A `Company` posts a `Job` in a standard format requiring certain skills. The `Job` also has hourly payment amount which the `Interviewer` gets paid on conducting the interview.
- The algorithm searches the database and creates a `Match`. A `Match` has one `Interviewer`, one `Jobseeker` and one `Job` attached to it.
- Both the `Interviewer` and the `Jobseeker` has to "accept" the `Match` for it to convert into an `Interview`.
- If either party declines, the algorithm keeps searching until it finds a pair.
- When an `Interview` is scheduled, the parties meet via Zoom, Hopin or similar.
- After the interview is conducted, the `Interviewer` gets paid.
- Based on the interview outcome, the `Company` schedules more rounds with other interviewers on the platform or conducts their own final in-house round. This depends on their hiring process which is also outlined in the `Job`.

**Benefits to Jobseekers**

- Not flushed out by the ATS gatekeepers.
- Not having to wait forever. A human reading the CV is guaranteed. First round guaranteed.
- Very short turnaround times whether it's a yes or no. So they can move on fast and not keep hoping.
- Very clear idea on whether the company considers remote or relocation / sponsorship etc. No gray area there.
- "Company culture", "we're a family", all this sort of stuff comes up in the last round. So a jobseeker doesn't have to do a PhD for every interview about the company only to know that "they found another candidate". Skills and job function come first. Because let's face it, no one's going to stay forever.
- When somebody is laid off, they have better chances of finding employment faster.

**Benefits to employers**
- Current employees focus on job function and not interviewing / hiring.
- Cost to company is reduced because interviewing is delegated to vetted external interviewers.
- Access to vast talent pool.
- Not being unable to fill a position because ATS flushes out strong candidates with a not so strongly formatted resume.
- Better chance to getting a good candidate because they're being interviewed by a human. On one side, you can flush out candidates who just copy paste keywords from the JD into their resume. On the other hand, you don't lose out on great candidates that didn't use the right keywords.

**Benefits to interviewers**

- Quick weekly cash payouts. To earn more, a skilled and qualified person shouldn't have to deliver food or drive a taxi when they can use their already existing skills to earn more.
- Same applies to highly qualified folks doing lower than minimum wage jobs to survive. They can utilize their already existing skills.
- A jobseeker can also be an interviewer on the f(ATS) platform. It doesn't hurt to earn while looking for a new job.
