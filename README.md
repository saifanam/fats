# f(ATS)
A B2B and B2C platform that connects headhunters, vetted interviewers and jobseekers.

**Why f(ATS)?**

One of the problems that is all too common is that employers can't find qualified people to fill the vacancies in their companies. However, on the other hand, there is no dearth of qualified jobseekers out in the market trying to land their dream role. So what's going on? Are the employers too demanding? Are the jobseekers not qualified enough to make the cut? Is the pay too low for all the points to be checked in the job description? While there is a certain degree of truth to all of those, more often that not, it's just a game of keywords.

A lot of employers delegate HR operations to third party firms that use automated Applicant Tracking System tools that sift through a gazillion resumes and filters out the ones they "think" are good enough. The standard advice floating around in the market is to modify your CV to have similar (or same) keywords as that of the job description. This is to go past the ATS gatekeeper. The irony is that a significant number of employers and jobseekers alike are not aware of this. The unpleasant truth is that lots of CVs aren't even looked at by a human. With the alarm bells ringing everywhere as AI becomes more and more potent, only time can tell what it's going to look like in a few years from now.

Enter f(ATS). It has ATS in its name but it doesn't work like the typical ATS at all. So why that name? We'll know in time. Our aim is to address two core problems:

- Employers should be able to fill the vacancies on time with confidence without having to depend on HR solutions.
- Jobseekers will not have to wait forever to hear back a "yes" or "no".

**How it works:**

- The f(ATS) platform has three categories of registered users: `Company`, `Interviewer` and `Jobseeker`.
- Interviewers are vetted individuals with expertise in specific areas to be able to interview candidates having those same skills. Interviewers are not necessarily employed by the company that has posted the job. Think of them as freelancers or contractors on the f(ATS) platform.
- A user registered as a `Jobseeker` can also have an `Interviewer` profile. The analogy is like a food delivery app. You can both order food and sign up as a courier to deliver food.
- A `Company` posts a `Job`, which is a description of the vacancy in a standard predetermined format and the hourly pay for the `Interviewer` if they accept the offer to conduct the interview on behalf of the `Company`.
- The algorithm searches the database on the platform to find a two-way match. Each `Match` has one `Job`, one `Interviewer` and one `Jobseeker` attached to it. Both the jobseeker and the interviewer has to "accept" the `Match` for it to convert into an `Interview`.
- If the `Jobseeker` declines the `Match`, the algorithm will search for the next suitable `Jobseeker` to pair with the `Interviewer`. Similarly, if the `Interviewer` declines, the algorithm searches for the next available Interviewer to pair up with the `Jobseeker`. This process continues until both the parties accept.
- When an `Interview` is scheduled, the parties meet over Zoom, Hopin or similar and the first round is conducted. 
- After the `Interview`, the `Interviewer` gets paid the amount guaranteed in the `Job` posting. Based on the outcome, the`Company` can conduct more rounds with the candidate through the platform (depending on their hiring process) or the final in-house round with their own employees.

**Benefits to Jobseekers**

- Not flushed out by the ATS gatekeepers.
- Not having to wait forever. A human reading the CV is guaranteed. First round of interview guaranteed.
- Very short turnaround times whether it's a yes or no. So they can move on fast and not keep hoping.
- Very clear idea on whether the company considers remote or relocation / sponsorship etc. No gray area there. These criteria will all be part of the standard format of the JD on the platform.
- "Company culture", "we're a family", all this sort of stuff comes at the last round. So a jobseeker doesn't have to do a PhD for every interview about the company only to know that "they found another candidate". Skills and job function come first. Because let's face it, no one's going to stay for ever.
- When somebody is laid off, they have better chances of finding employment faster.

**Benefits to employers**
- Current employees can focus on their respective job functions and not on interviewing / hiring.
- Cost to company is reduced because interviewing is delegated to vetted external interviewers.
- Access to vast talent pool.
- Not being unable to fill a position because ATS flushes out strong candidates with a not so strongly formatted resume.
- Better chances of getting a good candidate because they are being interviewed by a human. On one side, you get to flush out candidates who just copy paste keywords from the JD into their resume. On the other hand, you don't lose out on great candidates who didn't use the right keywords.

**Benefits to interviewers**

- Quick weekly cash payouts. To earn more, a skilled and qualified person shouldn't have to deliver food or drive a taxi when they can use their already existing skills to earn more.
- Same applies to highly qualified folks doing lower than minimum wage jobs to survive. They can utilize their already existing skills.
- A jobseeker can also be an interviewer on the f(ATS) platform. It definitely doesn't hurt to earn while looking for a new job.
